# Find Them All

This application is my first full-stack app and was built to demonstrate my ability to work with a backend as a service. The goal of the project was to create an interactive game where players can find Iron Giant, Gandalf, Groot, and Waldo within a large image. The game is built using React, CSS, Browser Router, and Firebase/Firestore and is a fun and exciting way to test your skills and see how fast you can find all the characters.

## Features

- Find Iron Giant, Gandalf, Groot, and Waldo within a large image
- Timed game to see how fast you can find all the characters
- Submit your username to the leaderboard after finding all the characters
- View the top 100 fastest times on the leaderboard

## Technologies Used

- React
- Browser Router
- Firebase/Firestore
- CSS

## Note

Please note that because of the size of the character images in the game, it was not designed for, and does not look nice on mobile devices. It is recommended to play the game on a larger screen.
